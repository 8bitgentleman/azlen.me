        <h1>Three engagement factors</h1>
        
            <p><span>Why?<ul><li>Because none of these engagement factors works well on its own. A goal without knowing the tools or space (the how or what) to achieve that goal is simply just a dream. If you only have one engagement factor it can feel limiting or boring.</li></ul></span></p>
        
            <p><span>Most mediums we interact with are passive: books, movies, social media. However <a class="internal" data-uuid="mGB7thFQ" href="/mGB7thFQ">Games are inherently engaging mediums</a> because they combine three important factors for engagement: goals, spaces, and tools.</span></p>

            <p><span>My theory is that at least two of these engagement factors are required to create engagement</span></p>
        
            <p><span>Most games provide all three engagement factors simultaneously, but in the case of books and movies, <a class="internal" data-uuid="Hushqp3V" href="/Hushqp3V">Static media often provide only one engagement factor at a time</a>. At least two are required to create engagement. If you read a book that gives writing advice (tools), but you do not have a goal in mind to write something you may not internalize the advice well, or only later engage with it. However if you have a project that you're working on (a goal) then a book related to this project will give you either the space or the tools to reach towards your goals (<a class="internal" data-uuid="MtBNxyXK" href="/MtBNxyXK">Personal projects structure learning and engagement</a>).</span></p>

            <p><span>It might not be sufficient to simply create two engagement factors, there are many more factors at play such as the depth and complexity of those factors, how well they work together in tandem, and how "fun" the overall system is.</span></p>

            <p><span><h2>Questions</h2><ul><li></li><li>How do games switch between different engagement approaches? what is the "engagement graph"?</li><li>Can the engagement be engaging? Nested engagement (e.g. exploration for the purpose of future curiosity)</li><li>What about the difference between focused mind and unfocused mind in engagement? Does your mind have to be focused?</li><li>How does the time affect this triangle of engagement?</li><li>If I say that I was really engaged with something immersive, where do I draw the line? <a class="internal" data-uuid="87c5trme" href="/87c5trme">Engaging mediums encourage thought</a>, but sometimes immersive mediums can also create thought. I think perhaps that immersivity is a subset of engagement?<ul><li>Immersive mediums are sort of engaging over larger time scales, engaging mediums are engaging in the moment. Immersive mediums might make you think of them at a later point but be immersed in the moment, but engaging mediums make you think in the moment and may or may not make you think later (probably they do though)</li></ul></li><li>This outlines engagement in the moment, but what about over time (is this the third time I've asked a time question?), engagement over time requires something to look forward to, some mystery, human interaction is perfect for engagement over time. And perhaps immersive mediums are engaging over time but not usually productively engaging...</li><li>I wonder, what if you provide goal+tool, then use the same tool to provide goal+space, and then use the same space to provide space+goal, can you have this cyclical form of engagement where each type of engagement builds off the last? This could be a very interesting experiment</li><li>This is only the basic outline of my approaches to engagement, it serves as a foundational landscape for my thinking in this area. How engaging something is depends on a plenitude of other factors that cannot simply be reduced to a checklist and may be unique to each medium.</li><li>How might I begin to break this page up into a bunch of separate subpages?</li><li>Note: Space and goal have parallels to declarative and procedural knowledge in educational psychology</li></ul></span></p>

                <p class="backlink-text">Most mediums are not inherently engaging. Reading, watching and consuming content is typically a passive cycle. The level of engagement with material depends on each individual reader. The problem perhaps is when there is no reason to engage, no goal or structure through which to engage (Three engagement factors). </p>

                <p class="backlink-text">Andy mentions that Most games aren’t enabling environments which I find interesting because Games are inherently engaging mediums. But not all engaging mediums are enabling environments. Thinking back to Three engagement factors, a common pattern across the examples is the environment of curiosity: enabling environments provide a space and tools to navigate that space towards your own personal goals (and not the goals that the environment places upon you like in games or school)</p>
