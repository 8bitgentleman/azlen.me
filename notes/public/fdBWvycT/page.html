        <h1>University education is a medium of exchange</h1>
        
            <p><span>Money creates a layer of abstraction, instead of trading apples for oranges I sell my apples to buy your oranges. In between there is money, the middleman that gives us the opportunity to exchange goods. And thus you can exchange labour for money which then you can exchange for sustenance and worldly possessions. The function of university is similar. Instead of transacting in knowledge or having learnt from a great mentor, learning becomes abstracted into the gold coin of a university diploma, with which we can buy our place in the job market. Your teacher does not matter, your skill does not matter, it is the abstraction, the medium of exchange that we want.</span></p>
        
            <p><span>University is a second-order medium of exchange</span></p>
        
            <p><span><a class="internal" data-uuid="jZ9Do9aZ" href="/jZ9Do9aZ">Mediums of exchange create unhappiness</a><ul><li>Working jobs you don't like to get money to survive</li><li>Learning things you're not interested in to get a better chance at a job you like</li><li>Doing things you don't want to get into the best university to learn things you're not interested in to get a job you don't like to make money to survive</li></ul></span></p>
        
            <p><span>Through this metaphor, one might wonder what the are the "economics" of the educational transaction? Or rather shall we call it edunomics. How is money created? Money is created through debt. Money is printed. What is educational debt?</span></p>
        
            <p><span>By being a medium of exchange this activates greed, makes us want the best education, makes us want to have the most valuable education.</span></p>
        
            <p><span>How to reframe universities as a circular economy of education?</span></p>

            <p><span>Professors make, students use, but the cycle does not continue and we end up forgetting, getting rid of knowledge. How can you incorporate reuse, remaking, and recycling into education?</span></p>
        
            <p><span>I think <a class="internal" data-uuid="SGtxrLDh" href="/SGtxrLDh">Peer-to-peer educational models could create a circular economy of education</a>. Instead of assigning the making of learning to professors it gives the students the power to make and remake their own learning and find the teachers they want. Professionals in society can reuse their knowledge to help teach the younger generation and this cycle could become circular</span></p>
        
            <p><span>Have we reached an education bubble?</span></p>
