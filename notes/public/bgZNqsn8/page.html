        <h1>Language of interaction</h1>
        
            <p><span>Can interaction be thought of in terms of a language?</span></p>
        
            <p><span><strong>Objects/nouns</strong> are the physical objects, interface elements, and multi-sensory aesthetics of a system (visual, auditory, etc)<ul><li><strong>Hyperobjects</strong> are “things that are massively distributed, very large relative to humans, whether directly manufactured by humans or not” (Morton, 2013)</li></ul></span></p>
        
            <p><span><strong>Verbs</strong> are the interactions, game mechanics, and affordances of a system. <a class="internal" data-uuid="LBX4ZqqY" href="/LBX4ZqqY">Verbs multiply the possibility of interaction</a></span></p>
        
            <p><span><strong>Adjectives</strong> are are the feelings and moods that arise out of the verbs and objects<ul><li>Perhaps a <strong>Hyperadjective</strong> could be a collection of feelings and adjectives spread across many people? E.g. Culture, aesthetic movements (e.g. minimalism), genres</li></ul></span></p>
        
            <p><span><strong>Bodies</strong> are the pronouns of interaction, whether figma cursors, game avatars, google doc carets, or your body in physical space.</span></p>
        
            <p><span><strong>Grammar</strong> is the arrangement of objects, verbs and adjectives over time?</span></p>

                <p class="backlink-text">Computer have a Language of interaction⁠—clicking, scrolling, dragging, typing are some of the core "verbs" in the proto-language that is digital interfaces. However these are just the building blocks upon which more complex words and structures of interaction can evolve. </p>
