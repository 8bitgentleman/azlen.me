        <h1>Writing clarifies thought</h1>
        
            <p><span>The act of writing forces you to organize and distill your ideas into something more tangible. Through writing you uncover foggy areas of your thinking or understanding, and in the process you work to clarify these ideas not only on the page but within your mind. This creates a positive feedback loop: writing clarifies thought, and clearer thought leads to more elaborate or meaningful writing.</span></p>
        
            <p><span>If writing clarifies thought then densely linked writing builds the underlying foundation or landscape for thought.</span></p>
