        <h1>Spaces can rewrite social norms</h1>
        
            <p><span>In art galleries we stand around staring at rectangles on the wall. In restaurants we sit in our own bubble and do not dare strike up conversation with other patrons. Along big streets people seem to walk faster and avoid eye contact. Different spaces give the opportunity to rewrite social norms, to determine what is  normal in that space. This should be kept in mind when designing new spaces, can a building foster community and allow you to meet and talk to strangers as if they were your friends? (hint: the answer is yes, and buildings like this already exist)</span></p>
