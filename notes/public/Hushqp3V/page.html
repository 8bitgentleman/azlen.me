                <p class="backlink-text">Static media often provide only one engagement factor at a time. If you read a book that gives writing advice (tools), but you do not have a goal in mind to write something you may not internalise the advice well, or only later engage with it. However if you have a project that you're working on (a goal) then a book related to this project will give you either the space or the tools to reach towards your goals (Personal projects structure learning and engagement).</p>
