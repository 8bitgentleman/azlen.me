                <p class="backlink-text">I think Peer-to-peer educational models could create a circular economy of education. Instead of assigning the making of learning to professors it gives the students the power to make and remake their own learning and find the teachers they want. Professionals in society can reuse their knowledge to help teach the younger generation and this cycle could become circular</p>
