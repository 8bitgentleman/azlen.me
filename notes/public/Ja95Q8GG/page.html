        <h1>The internet is like a city</h1>
        
            <p><span>The information highway is a relatively common metaphor to describe the city. I would take this further and describe the internet as a city—or multiple cities—with Google and other search engines forming the highways in-between and through them.</span></p>
        
            <p><span>I believe that the principles behind good urban form and community are very similar to the principles of an ideal internet; and that the modern american city shares many similar qualities and shortcomings as does the structure of the internet, simply through a different spatial medium.</span></p>

                <p class="backlink-text">The internet is like a city, there is a giant 20-lane superhighway running straight through the middle. The city sprawls out forever and even with a map it becomes difficult to find what you are looking for. Instead you pull over for a pit stop and end up watching videos in the YouTube district. Domain specific search helps in that it creates smaller highways, but often it simply feels easier to take the superhighway.</p>

                <p class="backlink-text">You have somewhere you need to go so you head outside and a few blocks later you might bump into a friend or acquaintance. Good neighbourhoods facilitate chance encounters. If The internet is like a city, how could similar encounters could be facilitated through the internet? </p>
