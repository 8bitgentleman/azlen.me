        <h1>Design systems before form</h1>
        
            <p><span>If a designer takes inspiration from nature on form alone, they will design for you a plastic plant. An object which looks like the real thing with none of its function, destined for the landfill where it will destroy that which inspired it. However, if this same designer took inspiration instead from the systems of nature, they might design something which grows, something that is self-sustaining, something that doesn't end up in that landfill but instead is repurposed or "decomposed" in some form. The world, unfortunately, is full of plastic plants.</span></p>
