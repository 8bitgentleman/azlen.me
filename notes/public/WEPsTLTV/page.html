                <p class="backlink-title">The internet lacks platforms for bringing people together to learn collectively</p>
                <p class="backlink-text">Boundless are the number of learning platforms and MOOCs offered by universities but MOOCs fail to engage students and are generally taken alone without much sense of community or peer-interaction. There are few platforms which bring people together to learn or work on a problem collectively. Complice tackles accountability with silent coworking rooms, but is not a binding agent bringing people together around a single task or topic but rather a catalyst for each person's individual goals and projects.</p>
