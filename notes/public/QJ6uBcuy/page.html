        <h1>Kishōtenketsu</h1>
        
            <p><span>Kishōtenketsu is a narrative structure typically used in Japanese literature. It is made up of four stages: introduction, development, twist, and conclusion. There is no need for conflict as the twist of the story simply subverts our expectations and assumptions.</span></p>
        
            <p><span><a class="internal" data-uuid="8VXr9WUx" href="/8VXr9WUx">Language is at the heart of communication through any medium</a> and because of this <a class="internal" data-uuid="TmGeWWsK" href="/TmGeWWsK">Narrative structures seep into everyday life</a>. Japanese game designers for example used the Kishōtenketsu narrative structure when designing levels for Super Mario World (?). The introduction, development helps introduce a game mechanic in a safe space and the twist gives you the challenge of using this mechanic in a strange or unfamiliar way.</span></p>
