            <p><span>In an fMRI study, certain films have very high inter-subject correlation of thought patterns (Hasson et al, 2008). This points towards film literally replacing our own internal narrative of thought with its own narrative as we become deeply immersed into the film. A similar effect can be seen across any medium of consumption. When we read we stepping into the author's thoughts or world they have constructed, often leaving our own thought process behind.</span></p>
        
            <p><span>The level of immersivity depends both on the medium and the reader. Some may be more engaged with material than others: writing, questioning, taking notes, turning the medium into more of a conversation (<a class="internal" data-uuid="V42qDrst" href="/V42qDrst">Three engagement factors</a>).</span></p>

                <p class="backlink-text">Engagement is an active loop of participation, or conversation with a medium. Games are inherently engaging mediums because they create create active participation. Conversely books and television tend to be primarily immersive mediums (Immersive mediums replace thought) which do not require active participation.</p>
