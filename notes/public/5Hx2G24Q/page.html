                <p class="backlink-text">As well, it is not natural to be looking directly at everyone taking part in a conversation. Even in a 1:1 conversation often you'll be sitting or walking side-by-side and not looking straight on at the other person the whole time. Looking directly at each other makes silence awkward. There is also an inability to make eye-contact or properly look away (point your attention to some object in your shared environment), which creates an unnatural situation which can leave you feeling much more exhausted than in-person interaction.</p>
