        <h1>Playgrounds for the mind</h1>
        
            <p><span>Places of play, invention, and joy—the playground is not designed for an anti-purpose, instead of being designed with a specific goal in mind it is a place where people can come up with their own goals, create their own games, and have fun. Thinking back to my <a class="internal" data-uuid="nJHwBEjP" href="/nJHwBEjP">Three approaches to engagement</a>, the playground takes the space of curiosity where you are given a space and a set of actions to explore and interact with this space. I am curious, what would it look like to design a playground for the mind? a place to explore and come up with ideas, create your own games, and explore conceptual space in a similar way that playgrounds make it fun to move about physical space.</span></p>
        
            <p><span>Playgrounds are locations, you can visit and you can leave. <a class="internal" data-uuid="6AAWERe9" href="/6AAWERe9">Spaces can rewrite social norms</a>—how might social norms be rewritten to interact playfully with ideas?</span></p>
        
            <p><span>Playgrounds are flexible spaces, you can imagine it to be anything you want. Therefore a playground for the mind should be able to apply across many different concepts and ideas.</span></p>
        
            <p><span>Playgrounds are multiplayer, it is a place where groups of friends gather to play. The playground is not a solitary act. How can a playground for the mind enable us to think together?</span></p>
