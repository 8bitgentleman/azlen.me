                <p class="backlink-text">Note taking systems are like planting a garden. Ideas are like seeds that you plant which take time to grow and produce fruit. Treating writing like gardening begs a broader consideration of your work over longer timescales, to make a consistent practice of tending to your garden of ideas every day, and make sure to pull out any weeds that may have taken root.</p>
