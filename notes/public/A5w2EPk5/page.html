        <h1>What writing can learn from gardening</h1>
        
            <p><span><a class="internal" data-uuid="3FVLF62X" href="/3FVLF62X">Note taking systems are like planting a garden</a>. Ideas are like seeds that you plant which take time to grow and produce fruit. Treating writing like gardening begs a broader consideration of your work over longer timescales, to make a consistent practice of tending to your garden of ideas every day, and make sure to pull out any weeds that may have taken root.</span></p>
        
            <p><span>One can also take inspiration from rhizomes, interconnected root systems beneath the ground. By linking together notes, you can strengthen the growth of all your ideas. Similar to the ideas of the Zettelkasten and Memex.</span></p>
        
            <p><span><h2>Questions</h2><ul><li>Old ideas may eventually be composted for new ideas to take root?</li><li>Are there seasons of writing?</li><li>What are the techniques and skills of expert gardeners? How can these be applied to writing?</li><li>Starting seedlings in a small container before planting in the ground?</li><li>Build a trellis (framework) on which plants can grow and be supported?</li></ul></span></p>
