        <h1>Hidden question between every pair of sentences</h1>
        
            <p><span>When reading there are often things left unsaid or unanswered. These unknown elements create tension and interest which draws the reader in to discover more. I like to imagine there being a hidden question between every pair of sentences. These questions pull on the strings of questions left unanswered, and open the space to answer them. Sometimes the question will be as simple as "why?" or "and what happened next?" but imagining the question can help create a sense of continuity in your writing and prevent jumping around quickly between different ideas.</span></p>
        
            <p><span>This helps personally because my mind will sometimes move on to new ideas so fast that when I write, each sentence is almost unrelated to the last. By imagining a question about the previous sentence I can make sure to stay on track with my thoughts and not get too far ahead of myself.</span></p>
