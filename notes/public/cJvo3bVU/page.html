            <p><span>Twitter (and likely other social networks) can facilitate chance encounters like these to an extent, but the analogy here would be closer to bumping into people in a very, very crowded public square full of conversations; it's loud, and everyone is trying to speak above everyone else to get their voice heard.</span></p>
        
            <p><span>Perhaps a better approach would be to facilitate chance encounters on the quiet side-streets of the internet. If you're heading somewhere, you might bump into someone somewhere along the path. On the internet, you navigate the city through search, so this would be the ideal place to bump into friends and people in your network.

Instead I think we need to move towards hyper-localized internet structures where you search and wander around your own network/community of people.
