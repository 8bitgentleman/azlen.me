            <p><span>I have been thinking about what kinds of tools or sequences of thought can lead to interesting or new ideas. How can you move, rotate, and jump over obstacles of thought? This comes out of thinking about <a class="internal" data-uuid="SxRusvcR" href="/SxRusvcR">What writing can learn from game design</a>, but I found my experiments to be useful beyond just writing.</span></p>
        
            <p><span>Not sure how to structure this page, I think these techniques would be better understood through visual diagrams than through writing on the screen.</span></p>

                <p class="backlink-text">"Why?" is one of the most powerful questions in my toolbelt of Mental acrobatics. Asking why forces you to question what you know and connect to broader contexts within your mind. If you imagine Conceptual space is like a landscape, this question can help explore the roots and landscape surrounding an idea and help to discover the deeper, more fundamental meanings underlying that idea.</p>
