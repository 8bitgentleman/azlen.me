In my personal model for engagement there are three approaches to engagement: Puzzle, exploration, and curiosity. Each approach combines two engagement factors.</span></p>
        
            <p><span>Note: Two engagement factors alone might not be sufficient, there are many more factors at play such as the depth and complexity of those factors, how well they work together in tandem, and how "fun" the overall system is.</span></p>

            <p><span>One of the most powerful approaches to engagement is curiosity. By giving the participant tools and space to explore and achieve their own goals you can create an <a class="internal" data-uuid="k9xDPpLQ" href="/k9xDPpLQ">Enabling environment</a>.</span></p>

                <p class="backlink-text">Places of play, invention, and joy—the playground is not designed for an anti-purpose, instead of being designed with a specific goal in mind it is a place where people can come up with their own goals, create their own games, and have fun. Thinking back to my Three approaches to engagement, the playground takes the space of curiosity where you are given a space and a set of actions to explore and interact with this space. I am curious, what would it look like to design a playground for the mind? a place to explore and come up with ideas, create your own games, and explore conceptual space in a similar way that playgrounds make it fun to move about physical space.</p>
