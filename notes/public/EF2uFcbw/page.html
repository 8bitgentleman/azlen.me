            <p><span>New ideas are formed by combining and linking together existing ideas. These intersections and connections open not only develop your conceptual landscape (<a class="internal" data-uuid="Qi5zvNTZ" href="/Qi5zvNTZ">Conceptual space is like a landscape</a>), but it can bring you to explore new areas of thought.</span></p>

                <p class="backlink-text">Instead, Insight comes at the intersection of ideas. Do not shatter the bowl but look at it in different contexts and settings to understand its beauty. Place the idea of a "city" in the context of "education," how does a city help us to learn? Or in the context of a "book," how do you <em>read</em> a city? Through these questions you can not only be more specific in your search but also spark new questions and curiosity.</p>
