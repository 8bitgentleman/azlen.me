            <p><span>There are no hard boundaries between disciplines. That which is learned in one discipline can no doubt be applied to another.

                <p class="backlink-text">Over the years authors have used many Metaphors of writing to describe and inform the writing process. Language is at the heart of communication through any medium and thus shares qualities which can easily be transformed through metaphors and analogy. These metaphors however have not been explored in depth. How can the techniques of architecture, cinematography, gardening, or game development be used to inform one's writing practice? What new styles and techniques could emerge from this exploration? And in turn what could these disciplines learn from writing? (Interdisciplinarity is multiplicative)</p>
