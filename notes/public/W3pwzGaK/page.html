I cannot open Premiere Pro and begin brainstorming ideas for a video to make, instead the video editor comes in the final stage of the process.</span></p>

                <p class="backlink-text">Paper is still the best tool for thought. With paper you can write, draw, cut, fold, and organize your ideas however you like. There is little difference between writing text on the page and doodling in the sidelines. On a computer however, these may well require separate apps; typically Applications are designed for authoring not thinking.</p>
